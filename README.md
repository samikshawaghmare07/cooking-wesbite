## 🍽️ Cooking Website

This is a simple and responsive cooking website created to showcase various recipes along with their ingredients and cooking steps. The website is designed with a clean layout to make browsing recipes easy and enjoyable for users.

The project was developed as part of a learning process to improve front-end web development skills. It focuses on using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for basic interactivity.

This website helps users explore different dishes, understand cooking procedures clearly, and get inspired to try new recipes at home. The code structure is beginner-friendly and easy to understand.

The project demonstrates practical implementation of web design concepts and provides hands-on experience in building a complete website from scratch.
